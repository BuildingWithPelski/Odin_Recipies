    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A perfectly seared, tender steak, cooked to your desired doneness, is elegantly topped or served alongside a luxurious, house-made sauce. The rich, savory flavor of the meat pairs harmoniously with the complementary notes of the sauce, creating a balanced and indulgent dining experience</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the Steak:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steak:</strong> Boneless ribeye, sirloin, or New York strip.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong>Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Fat:</strong> Vegetable oil or butter for searing. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Steak:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Let steaks come to room temp, pat dry, and season well with salt & pepper. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sear:</strong> Heat oil in a heavy skillet (cast-iron is great) over high heat until smoking. Sear steaks 2-4 mins per side for a nice crust (adjust for doneness).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Rest:</strong>Transfer steaks to a plate, loosely tent with foil, and let rest 5-10 mins (this keeps them juicy). </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Make the Pan Sauce:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> In the same pan (drain excess fat, but leave browned bits), lower heat and sauté minced shallots and garlic in butter for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Deglaze:</strong>Pour in liquid like red wine, beef broth, or brandy, scraping up all the flavorful fond from the bottom. Simmer until reduced by about half.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong>Turn off the heat and whisk in heavy cream, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and a knob of cold butter until smooth and emulsified. Add peppercorns if desired. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
